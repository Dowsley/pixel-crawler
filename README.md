# Pixel Crawler
The goal of this game, besides making cool music, is to implement Wave Function Collapse into Pixel Crawlers.

The following are the methods I either plan to apply or have already applied:

## Mode 0: Completely random (Ongoing)
For comparisons.  

## Mode 1: Single-tile-based generation (Ongoing)
Primitive generation. Will work, but there's much room for improvement.

## Mode 2: High-level architecture generated layer first, then filling in details with Mode 1 (Planned)
